/**
\page Function Functions

When performing biased dynamics or analysing a trajectory you may wish to analyse/bias the value of
some function of a set of collective variables rather than the values of the collective variables
directly.  You can do this with PLUMED by using any one of the following list of functions: 

<table align=center frame=void width=95%% cellpadding=5%%>
<tr> <td width=5%> \subpage COMBINE </td> <td>Calculate a polynomial combination of a set of other variables.</td> </tr>
<tr> <td width=5%> \subpage ENSEMBLE </td> <td>Calculates the replica averaging of a collective variable over multiple replicas.</td> </tr>
<tr> <td width=5%> \subpage FUNCPATHMSD </td> <td>This function calculates path collective variables. </td> </tr>
<tr> <td width=5%> \subpage FUNCSUMHILLS </td> <td>This function is intended to be called by the command line tool sum_hillsand it is meant to integrate a HILLS file or an HILLS file interpreted as a histogram i a variety of ways. Therefore it is not expected that you use this during your dynamics (it will crash!)</td> </tr>
<tr> <td width=5%> \subpage MATHEVAL </td> <td>Calculate a combination of variables using a matheval expression.</td> </tr>
<tr> <td width=5%> \subpage PIECEWISE </td> <td>Compute a piecewise straight line through its arguments that passes througha set of ordered control points. </td> </tr>
<tr> <td width=5%> \subpage SORT </td> <td>This function can be used to sort colvars according to their magnitudes.</td> </tr>
