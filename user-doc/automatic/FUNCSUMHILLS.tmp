This function is intended to be called by the command line tool sum_hills
and it is meant to integrate a HILLS file or an HILLS file interpreted as 
a histogram i a variety of ways. Therefore it is not expected that you use this 
during your dynamics (it will crash!)

In the future one could implement periodic integration during the metadynamics 
or straightforward MD as a tool to check convergence
