Calculate 3rd order Steinhardt parameters.

The 3rd order Steinhardt parameters allow us to measure the degree to which the first coordination shell
around an atom is ordered.  The Steinhardt parameter for atom, \f$i\f$ is complex vector whose components are 
calculated using the following formula:

\f[
q_{3m}(i) = \frac{\sum_j \sigma( r_{ij} ) Y_{3m}(\mathbf{r}_{ij}) }{\sum_j \sigma( r_{ij} ) }
\f]

where \f$Y_{3m}\f$ is one of the 3rd order spherical harmonics so \f$m\f$ is a number that runs from \f$-3\f$ to
\f$+3\f$.  The function \f$\sigma( r_{ij} )\f$ is a \ref switchingfunction that acts on the distance between 
atoms \f$i\f$ and \f$j\f$.  The parameters of this function should be set so that it the function is equal to one
when atom \f$j\f$ is in the first coordination sphere of atom \f$i\f$ and is zero otherwise.  

The Steinhardt parameters can be used to measure the degree of order in the system in a variety of different ways.  The
simplest way of measuring whether or not the coordination sphere is ordered is to simply take the norm of the above vector i.e.

\f[
Q_3(i) = \sqrt{ \sum_{m=-3}^3 q_{3m}(i)^{*} q_{3m}(i) }
\f]

This norm is small when the coordination shell is disordered and larger when the coordination shell is ordered. Furthermore, when 
the keywords LESS_THAN, MIN, MAX, HISTOGRAM, MEAN and so on are used with this colvar it is the distribution of these normed quantities
that is investigated.  

Other measures of order can be taken by averaging the components of the individual \f$q_3\f$ vectors individually or by taking dot products of 
the \f$q_{3}\f$ vectors on adjacent atoms.  More information on these variables can be found in the documentation for \ref LOCAL_Q3,
\ref LOCAL_AVERAGE and \ref NLINKS.

\par Examples

The following command calculates the average Q3 parameter for the 64 atoms in a box of Lennard Jones and prints this
quantity to a file called colvar:

\verbatim
Q3 SPECIES=1-64 D_0=1.3 R_0=0.2 MEAN LABEL=q3
PRINT ARG=q3.mean FILE=colvar
\endverbatim

The following command calculates the histogram of Q3 parameters for the 64 atoms in a box of Lennard Jones and prints these
quantities to a file called colvar:

\verbatim
Q3 SPECIES=1-64 D_0=1.3 R_0=0.2 HISTOGRAM={GAUSSIAN LOWER=0.0 UPPER=1.0 NBINS=20 SMEAR=0.1} LABEL=q3
PRINT ARG=q3.* FILE=colvar
\endverbatim

The following command could be used to measure the Q3 paramters that describe the arrangement of chlorine ions around the
sodium atoms in NaCl.  The imagined system here is composed of 64 NaCl formula units and the atoms are arranged in the input
with the 64 Na\f$^+\f$ ions followed by the 64 Cl\f$-\f$ ions.  Once again the average Q3 paramter is calculated and output to a 
file called colvar

\verbatim
Q3 SPECIESA=1-64 SPECIESB=65-128 D_0=1.3 R_0=0.2 MEAN LABEL=q3
PRINT ARG=q3.mean FILE=colvar
\endverbatim
