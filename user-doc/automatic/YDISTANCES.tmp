Calculate the y components of the vectors connecting one or many pairs of atoms.  
You can then calculate functions of the distribution of
values such as the minimum, the number less than a certain quantity and so on.

\par Examples

See documentation for \ref XDISTANCES for examples of how to use this command.
You just need to substitute YDISTANCES for XDISTANCES to investigate the y component
rather than the x component.
