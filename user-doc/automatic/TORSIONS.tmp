Calculate whether or not a set of torsional angles are within a particular range.

\par Examples

The following provides an example of the input for the torsions command

\verbatim
TORSIONS ...
ATOMS1=168,170,172,188
ATOMS2=170,172,188,190
ATOMS3=188,190,192,230 
LABEL=ab
... TORSIONS
PRINT ARG=ab.* FILE=colvar STRIDE=10
\endverbatim

Writing out the atoms involved in all the torsions in this way can be rather tedious. Thankfully if you are working with protein you
can avoid this by using the \ref MOLINFO command.  PLUMED uses the pdb file that you provide to this command to learn 
about the topology of the protein molecule.  This means that you can specify torsion angles using the following syntax:

\verbatim
MOLINFO MOLTYPE=protein STRUCTURE=myprotein.pdb
TORSIONS ...
ATOMS1=@phi-3
ATOMS2=@psi-3
ATOMS3=@phi-4
LABEL=ab
... TORSIONS 
PRINT ARG=ab FILE=colvar STRIDE=10
\endverbatim

Here, \@phi-3 tells plumed that you would like to calculate the \f$\phi\f$ angle in the third residue of the protein.  
Similarly \@psi-4 tells plumed that you want to calculate the \f$\psi\f$ angle of the 4th residue of the protein.
