Calculate the distances between a number of pairs of atoms and transform each distance by a switching function.
The transformed distance can be compared with a reference value in order to calculate the squared distance
between two contact maps. Each distance can also be weighted for a given value. CONTACTMAP can be used together
with \ref FUNCPATHMSD to define a path in the contactmap space.

\par Examples

The following example calculates switching functions based on the distances between atoms
1 and 2, 3 and 4 and 4 and 5. The values of these three switching functions are then output
to a file named colvar.

\verbatim
CONTACTMAP ATOMS1=1,2 ATOMS2=3,4 ATOMS3=4,5 ATOMS4=5,6 SWITCH=(RATIONAL R_0=1.5) LABEL=f1
PRINT ARG=f1.* FILE=colvar
\endverbatim

The following example calculates the difference of the current contact map with respect
to a reference provided. 

\verbatim
CONTACTMAP ...
ATOMS1=1,2 REFERENCE1=0.1 WEIGHT1=0.5 
ATOMS2=3,4 REFERENCE2=0.5 WEIGHT2=1.0 
ATOMS3=4,5 REFERENCE3=0.25 WEIGHT3=1.0 
ATOMS4=5,6 REFERENCE4=0.0 WEIGHT4=0.5 
SWITCH=(RATIONAL R_0=1.5) 
LABEL=cmap
CMDIST
... CONTACTMAP

PRINT ARG=cmap FILE=colvar
\endverbatim
