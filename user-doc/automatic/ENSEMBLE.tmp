Calculates the replica averaging of a collective variable over multiple replicas.

Each collective variable is averaged separately and stored in a component labelled <em>label</em>.cvlabel.  

Note that in case of variables such as \ref CS2BACKBONE, \ref CH3SHIFTS, \ref NOE and \ref RDC it is possible
to perform the replica-averaging inside the variable, in fact in those cases are the single experimental
values that averaged before calculating the collective variable.

\par Examples
The following input tells plumed to calculate the distance between atoms 3 and 5
and the average it over the available replicas.
\verbatim
dist: DISTANCE ATOMS=3,5 
ens: ENSEMBLE ARG=dist
PRINT ARG=dist,ens.dist
\endverbatim
(See also \ref PRINT and \ref DISTANCE).
