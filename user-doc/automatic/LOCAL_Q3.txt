Calculate the local degree of order around an atoms by taking the average dot product between the \f$q_3\f$ vector on the central atom and the \f$q_3\f$ vector
on the atoms in the first coordination sphere.

The \ref Q3 command allows one to calculate one complex vectors for each of the atoms in your system that describe the degree of order in the coordination sphere
around a particular atom. The difficulty with these vectors comes when combining the order parameters from all of the individual atoms/molecules so as to get a 
measure of the global degree of order for the system. The simplest way of doing this - calculating the average Steinhardt parameter - can be problematic. If one is 
examining nucleation say only the order parameters for those atoms in the nucleus will change significantly when the nucleus forms. The order parameters for the
atoms in the surrounding liquid will remain pretty much the same. As such if one models a small nucleus embedded in a very large amount of solution/melt any
change in the average order parameter will be negligible. Substantial changes in the value of this average can be observed in simulations of nucleation but only 
because the number of atoms is relatively small.  

When the average \ref Q3 parameter is used to bias the dynamics a problems
can occur. These averaged coordinates cannot distinguish between the correct,
single-nucleus pathway and a concerted pathway in which all the atoms rearrange
themselves into their solid-like configuration simultaneously. This second type
of pathway would be impossible in reality because there is a large entropic
barrier that prevents concerted processes like this from happening.  However,
in the finite sized systems that are commonly simulated this barrier is reduced
substantially. As a result in simulations where average Steinhardt parameters
are biased there are often quite dramatic system size effects

If one wants to simulate nucleation using some form on
biased dynamics what is really required is an order parameter that measures:

- Whether or not the coordination spheres around atoms are ordered
- Whether or not the atoms that are ordered are clustered together in a crystalline nucleus

\ref LOCAL_AVERAGE and \ref NLINKS are variables that can be combined with the Steinhardt parameteters allow to calculate variables that satisfy these requirements.
LOCAL_Q3 is another variable that can be used in these sorts of calculations. The LOCAL_Q3 parameter for a particular atom is a number that measures the extent to 
which the orientation of the atoms in the first coordination sphere of an atom match the orientation of the central atom.  It does this by calculating the following 
quantity for each of the atoms in the system:

\f[
 s_i = \frac{ \sum_j \sigma( r_{ij} ) \sum_{m=-3}^3 q_{3m}^{*}(i)q_{3m}(j) }{ \sum_j \sigma( r_{ij} ) }
\f]
 
where \f$q_{3m}(i)\f$ and \f$q_{3m}(j)\f$ are the 3rd order Steinhardt vectors calculated for atom \f$i\f$ and atom \f$j\f$ respectively and the asterix denotes complex
conjugation.  The function
\f$\sigma( r_{ij} )\f$ is a \ref switchingfunction that acts on the distance between atoms \f$i\f$ and \f$j\f$.  The parameters of this function should be set 
so that it the function is equal to one when atom \f$j\f$ is in the first coordination sphere of atom \f$i\f$ and is zero otherwise.  The sum in the numerator
of this expression is the dot product of the Steinhardt parameters for atoms \f$i\f$ and \f$j\f$ and thus measures the degree to which the orientations of these
adjacent atoms is correlated.

\par Description of components

When the label of this action is used as the input for a second you are not referring to a scalar quantity as you are in regular collective variables.  The label is used to reference the full set of quantities calculated by the action.  This is usual when using \ref multicolvarfunction. Generally when doing this the previously calculated multicolvar will be referenced using the DATA keyword rather than ARG.

This Action can be used to calculate the following scalar quantities directly.  These quantities are calculated by employing the keywords listed below. These quantities can then be referenced elsewhere in the input file by using this Action's label followed by a dot and the name of the quantity. Some amongst them can be calculated multiple times with different parameters.  In this case the quantities calculated can be referenced elsewhere in the input by using the name of the quantity followed by a numerical identifier e.g. <em>label</em>.lessthan-1, <em>label</em>.lessthan-2 etc.  When doing this and, for clarity we have made the label of the components customizable. As such by using the LABEL keyword in the description of the keyword input you can customize the component name
