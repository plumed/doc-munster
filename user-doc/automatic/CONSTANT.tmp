\par Examples

The following input instructs plumed to compute the distance
between atoms 1 and 2. If this distance is between 1.0 and 2.0, it is
printed. If it is lower than 1.0 (larger than 2.0), 1.0 (2.0) is printed

\verbatim
one: CONSTANT VALUE=1.0
two: CONSTANT VALUE=2.0
dis: DISTANCE ATOMS=1,2
sss: SORT ARG=one,dis,two
PRINT ARG=sss.2
\endverbatim
(See also \ref DISTANCE, \ref SORT, and \ref PRINT).
