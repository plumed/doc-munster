Calculate the probability density as a function of a few CVs either using kernel density estimation, or a discrete
histogram estimation. 

In case a kernel density estimation is used the probability density is estimated as a
continuos function on the grid with a BANDWIDTH defined by the user. In this case the normalisation is such that
the INTEGRAL over the grid is 1. In case a discrete density estimation is used the probabilty density is estimated
as a discrete function on the grid. In this case the normalisation is such that the SUM of over the grid is 1.

Additional material and examples can be also found in the tutorial \ref belfast-1.

<td> the input for this action is the scalar output from one or more other actions. The particular scalars that you will use are referenced using the label of the action. If the label appears on its own then it is assumed that the Action calculates a single scalar value.  The value of this scalar is thus used as the input to this new action.  If * or *.* appears the scalars calculated by all the proceding actions in the input file are taken.  Some actions have multi-component outputs and each component of the output has a specific label.  For example a \ref DISTANCE action labelled dist may have three componets x, y and z.  To take just the x component you should use dist.x, if you wish to take all three components then use dist.*.More information on the referencing of Actions can be found in the section of the manual on the PLUMED \ref Syntax.  Scalar values can also be referenced using POSIX regular expressions as detailed in the section on \ref Regex. To use this feature you you must compile PLUMED with the appropriate flag. </td>
