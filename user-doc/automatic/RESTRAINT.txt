Adds harmonic and/or linear restraints on one or more variables.  

Either or both
of SLOPE and KAPPA must be present to specify the linear and harmonic force constants
respectively.  The resulting potential is given by: 
\f[
  \sum_i \frac{k_i}{2} (x_i-a_i)^2 + m_i*(x_i-a_i)
\f].

The number of components for any vector of force constants must be equal to the number
of arguments to the action.

Additional material and examples can be also found in the tutorial \ref belfast-4 

\par Description of components

By default this Action calculates the following quantities. These quanties can be referenced elsewhere in the input by using this Action's label followed by a dot and the name of the quantity required from the list below.

<tr> <td width=5%> <b> Quantity </b> </td> <td> <b> Description </b> </td> </tr>
<tr>
<td width=15%> <b> bias </b></td>
<td> the instantaneous value of the bias potential </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width=15%> <b> force2 </b></td>
<td> the instantaneous value of the squared force due to this bias potential </td>

<td> the input for this action is the scalar output from one or more other actions. The particular scalars that you will use are referenced using the label of the action. If the label appears on its own then it is assumed that the Action calculates a single scalar value.  The value of this scalar is thus used as the input to this new action.  If * or *.* appears the scalars calculated by all the proceding actions in the input file are taken.  Some actions have multi-component outputs and each component of the output has a specific label.  For example a \ref DISTANCE action labelled dist may have three componets x, y and z.  To take just the x component you should use dist.x, if you wish to take all three components then use dist.*.More information on the referencing of Actions can be found in the section of the manual on the PLUMED \ref Syntax.  Scalar values can also be referenced using POSIX regular expressions as detailed in the section on \ref Regex. To use this feature you you must compile PLUMED with the appropriate flag. </td>

\par Examples
The following input tells plumed to restrain the distance between atoms 3 and 5
and the distance between atoms 2 and 4, at different equilibrium
values, and to print the energy of the restraint
\verbatim
DISTANCE ATOMS=3,5 LABEL=d1
DISTANCE ATOMS=2,4 LABEL=d2
RESTRAINT ARG=d1,d2 AT=1.0,1.5 KAPPA=150.0,150.0 LABEL=restraint
PRINT ARG=restraint.bias
\endverbatim
(See also \ref DISTANCE and \ref PRINT).
