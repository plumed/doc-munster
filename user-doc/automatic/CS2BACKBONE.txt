This collective variable calculates a scoring function based on the comparison of backcalculated and
experimental backbone chemical shifts for a protein (CA, CB, C', H, HA, N).

CamShift \cite Kohlhoff:2009us is employed to back calculate the chemical shifts that are then compared
with a set of experimental values to generate a score \cite Robustelli:2010dn \cite Granata:2013dk.

It is also possible to back-calculate the chemical shifts from multiple replicas and then average them
to perform Replica-Averaged Restrained MD simulations \cite Camilloni:2012je \cite Camilloni:2013hs.

In general the system for which chemical shifts are to be calculated must be completly included in
ATOMS. It should also be made whole \ref WHOLEMOLECULES before the the back-calculation. 

HOW TO COMPILE IT

\ref installingalmost on how to compile PLUMED with ALMOST.

HOW TO USE IT

To use CamShift a set of experimental data is needed. CamShift uses backbone and Cb chemical shifts 
that must be provided as text files:

\verbatim
CAshifts.dat:
CBshifts.dat:
Cshifts.dat:
Hshifts.dat:
HAshifts.dat:
Nshifts.dat:
#1 0.0
2 55.5
3 58.4
.
.
#last 0.0
#last+1 (first) of second chain
.
#last of second chain
\endverbatim

All of them must always be there. If a chemical shift for an atom of a residue is not available 0.0 must be used. 
So if for example all the Cb are not available all the chemical shifts for all the residues should be set as 0.0.

A template.pdb file is needed to the generate a topology of the protein within ALMOST. For histidines in protonation 
states different from D the HIE/HIP name should be used in the template.pdb. GLH and ASH can be used for the alternative 
protonation of GLU and ASP. Non-standard amino acids and other molecules are not yet supported! If multiple chains are 
present the chain identifier must be in the standard PDB format, together with the TER keyword at the end of each chain.
Residues numbering should always go from 1 to N in both the chemical shifts files as well as in the template.pdb file.
Two more keywords can be used to setup the topology: CYS-DISU to tell ALMOST to look for disulphide bridges and TERMINI
to define the protonation state of the the chain's termini (currently only DEFAULT (NH3+, CO2-) and NONE (NH, CO)).

Two more standard files are also needed: an ALMOST force-field file, corresponding to the force-field family used in
the MD code, (a03_cs2_gromacs.mdb for the amber family or all22_gromacs.mdb for the charmm family) and camshift.db, 
both these files can be copied from almost/branches/almost-2.1/toppar.

All the above files must be in a single folder that must be specified with the keyword DATA.
