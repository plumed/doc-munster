driver is a tool that allows one to to use plumed to post-process an existing trajectory.

The input to driver is specified using the command line arguments described below.

In addition, you can use the special \subpage READ command inside your plumed input
to read in colvar files that were generated during your MD simulation.  The values
read in can then be treated like calculated colvars. 

\par Examples

The following command tells plumed to postprocess the trajectory contained in trajectory.xyz
 by performing the actions described in the input file plumed.dat.  If an action that takes the
stride keyword is given a stride equal to \f$n\f$ then it will be performed only on every \f$n\f$th
frame in the trajectory file.
\verbatim
plumed driver --plumed plumed.dat --ixyz trajectory.xyz
\endverbatim

The following command tells plumed to postprocess the trajectory contained in trajectory.xyz.
 by performing the actions described in the input file plumed.dat. Here though
--trajectory-stride is set equal to the frequency with which frames were output during the trajectory
and the --timestep is equal to the simulation timestep.  As such the STRIDE parameters in the plumed.dat
files are no longer ignored and any files output resemble those that would have been generated
had we run the calculation we are running with driver when the MD simulation was running.
\verbatim
plumed driver --plumed plumed.dat --ixyz trajectory.xyz --trajectory-stride 100 --timestep 0.001
\endverbatim

By default you have access to a subset of the trajectory file formats
supported by VMD, e.g. xtc and dcd:

\verbatim
plumed driver --plumed plumed.dat --pdb diala.pdb --mf_xtc traj.xtc --trajectory-stride 100 --timestep 0.001
\endverbatim

where --mf_ prefixes the extension of one of the accepted molfile
plugin format.

To have support of all of VMD's plugins you need to recompile
PLUMED. You need to download the SOURCE of VMD, which contains
a plugins directory. Adapt build.sh and compile it. At
the end, you should get the molfile plugins compiled as a static
library libmolfile_plugin.a. Locate said file and libmolfile_plugin.h, 
and customize the configure command with something along
the lines of:

\verbatim
configure [...] LDFLAGS="-ltcl8.5 -L/mypathtomolfilelibrary/ -L/mypathtotcl" CPPFLAGS="-I/mypathtolibmolfile_plugin.h/"
\endverbatim

and rebuild. Check the available molfile plugins and limitations at http://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Research/vmd/plugins/molfile/.
