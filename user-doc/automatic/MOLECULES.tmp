Calculate the vectors connecting a pair of atoms in order to represent the orientation of a molecule.

At its simplest this command can be used to calculate the average length of an internal vector in a 
collection of different molecules.  When used in conjunction with MutiColvarFunctions in can be used
to do a variety of more complex tasks.

\par Examples

The following input tells plumed to calculate the distances between two of the atoms in a molecule.
This is done for the same set of atoms four different molecules and the average separation is then
calculated.

MOLECULES MOL1=1,2 MOL2=3,4 MOL3=5,6 MOL4=7,8 MEAN LABEL=mm
PRINT ARG=mm.mean FILE=colvar
\endverbatim
