This function can be used to sort colvars according to their magnitudes.

\par Description of components

This function sorts its arguments according to their magnitudes. The lowest argument will be 
labelled <em>label</em>.1, the second lowest will be labelled <em>label</em>.2 and so on.  

\par Compulsory keywords

 <table align=center frame=void width=95%% cellpadding=5%%> 
<tr>
<td width=15%> <b> ARG </b></td>
<td> the input for this action is the scalar output from one or more other actions. The particular scalars that you will use are referenced using the label of the action. If the label appears on its own then it is assumed that the Action calculates a single scalar value.  The value of this scalar is thus used as the input to this new action.  If * or *.* appears the scalars calculated by all the proceding actions in the input file are taken.  Some actions have multi-component outputs and each component of the output has a specific label.  For example a \ref DISTANCE action labelled dist may have three componets x, y and z.  To take just the x component you should use dist.x, if you wish to take all three components then use dist.*.More information on the referencing of Actions can be found in the section of the manual on the PLUMED \ref Syntax.  Scalar values can also be referenced using POSIX regular expressions as detailed in the section on \ref Regex. To use this feature you you must compile PLUMED with the appropriate flag. </td>

\par Examples
The following input tells plumed to print the distance of the closest and of
the farthest atoms to atom 1, chosen among atoms from 2 to 5
\verbatim
d12:  DISTANCE ATOMS=1,2
d13:  DISTANCE ATOMS=1,3
d14:  DISTANCE ATOMS=1,4
d15:  DISTANCE ATOMS=1,5
sort: SORT ARG=d12,d13,d14,d15
PRINT ARG=sort.1,sort.4
\endverbatim
(See also \ref PRINT and \ref DISTANCE).
