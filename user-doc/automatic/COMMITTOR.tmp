Does a committor analysis.

\par Examples
The following input monitors two torsional angles during a simulation,
defines two basins (A and B) as a function of the two torsions and 
stops the simulation when it falls in one of the two. In the log
file will be shown the latest values for the CVs and the basin reached.
