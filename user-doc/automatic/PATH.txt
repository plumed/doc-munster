Path collective variables with a more flexible framework for the distance metric being used. 

The Path Collective Variables developed by Branduardi and co-workers \cite brand07 allow one
to compute the progress along a high-dimensional path and the distance from the high-dimensional
path.  The progress along the path (s) is computed using:

\f[
s = \frac{ \sum_{i=1}^N i \exp( -\lambda R[X - X_i] ) }{ \sum_{i=1}^N \exp( -\lambda R[X - X_i] ) } 
\f]

while the distance from the path (z) is measured using:

\f[
z = -\frac{1}{\lambda} \ln\left[ \sum_{i=1}^N \exp( -\lambda R[X - X_i] ) \right]
\f]

In these expressions \f$N\f$ high-dimensional frames (\f$X_i\f$) are used to describe the path in the high-dimensional
space. The two expressions above are then functions of the distances from each of the high-dimensional frames \f$R[X - X_i]\f$.
Within PLUMED there are multiple ways to define the distance from a high-dimensional configuration.  You could calculate
the RMSD distance or you could calculate the ammount by which a set of collective variables change.  As such this implementation
of the path cv allows one to use all the difference distance metrics that are discussed in \ref dists. This is as opposed to 
the alternative implementation of path (\ref PATHMSD) which is a bit faster but which only allows one to use the RMSD distance.

<td> this keyword can be used to speed up your calculation. When accumulating sums in which the individual terms are numbers inbetween zero and one it is assumed that terms less than a certain tolerance make only a small contribution to the sum.  They can thus be safely ignored as can the the derivatives wrt these small quantities. </td>
