Calculate the probability density as a function of a few CVs either using kernel density estimation, or a discrete
histogram estimation. 

In case a kernel density estimation is used the probability density is estimated as a
continuos function on the grid with a BANDWIDTH defined by the user. In this case the normalisation is such that
the INTEGRAL over the grid is 1. In case a discrete density estimation is used the probabilty density is estimated
as a discrete function on the grid. In this case the normalisation is such that the SUM of over the grid is 1.

Additional material and examples can be also found in the tutorial \ref belfast-1. 
 
\par Examples

The following input monitors two torsional angles during a simulation
and outputs a continuos histogram as a function of them at the end of the simulation.

The following input monitors two torsional angles during a simulation
