Property maps but with a more flexible framework for the distance metric being used. 

This colvar calculates a property map using the formalism developed by Spiwork \cite Spiwok:2011ce.
In essence if you have the value of some property, \f$X_i\f$, that it takes at a set of high-dimensional
positions then you calculate the value of the property at some arbitrary point in the high-dimensional space
using:

\f[
X=\frac{\sum_i X_i*\exp(-\lambda D_i(x))}{\sum_i  \exp(-\lambda D_i(x))}
\f]

Within PLUMED there are multiple ways to define the distance from a high-dimensional configuration, \f$D_i\f$.  You could calculate
the RMSD distance or you could calculate the ammount by which a set of collective variables change.  As such this implementation
of the propertymap allows one to use all the different distance metric that are discussed in \ref dists. This is as opposed to 
the alternative implementation \ref PROPERTYMAP which is a bit faster but which only allows one to use the RMSD distance.

<tr>
<td width=15%> <b> TOL </b></td>
<td> this keyword can be used to speed up your calculation. When accumulating sums in which the individual terms are numbers inbetween zero and one it is assumed that terms less than a certain tolerance make only a small contribution to the sum.  They can thus be safely ignored as can the the derivatives wrt these small quantities. </td>
