Calculate whether or not a set of torsional angles are within a particular range.

\par Description of components

When the label of this action is used as the input for a second you are not referring to a scalar quantity as you are in regular collective variables.  The label is used to reference the full set of quantities calculated by the action.  This is usual when using \ref multicolvarfunction. Generally when doing this the previously calculated multicolvar will be referenced using the DATA keyword rather than ARG.

This Action can be used to calculate the following scalar quantities directly.  These quantities are calculated by employing the keywords listed below. These quantities can then be referenced elsewhere in the input file by using this Action's label followed by a dot and the name of the quantity. Some amongst them can be calculated multiple times with different parameters.  In this case the quantities calculated can be referenced elsewhere in the input by using the name of the quantity followed by a numerical identifier e.g. <em>label</em>.lessthan-1, <em>label</em>.lessthan-2 etc.  When doing this and, for clarity we have made the label of the components customizable. As such by using the LABEL keyword in the description of the keyword input you can customize the component name

 <table align=center frame=void width=95%% cellpadding=5%%> 
<tr> <td width=5%> <b> Quantity </b> </td> <td> <b> Keyword </b> </td> <td> <b> Description </b> </td> </tr>
<tr>
<td width=5%> <b> between </b></td> <td width=10%> <b> BETWEEN </b> </td> 
<td> the number/fraction of values within a certain range. This is calculated using one of the formula described in the description of the keyword so as to make it continuous. You can calculate this quantity multiple times using different parameters. </td>
</tr>

\par The atoms involved can be specified using

 <table align=center frame=void width=95%% cellpadding=5%%> 
<tr>
<td width=15%> <b> ATOMS </b></td>
<td> the atoms involved in each of the collective variables you wish to calculate. Keywords like ATOMS1, ATOMS2, ATOMS3,... should be listed and one CV will be calculated for each ATOM keyword you specify (all ATOM keywords should define the same number of atoms).  The eventual number of quantities calculated by this action will depend on what functions of the distribution you choose to calculate. You can use multiple instances of this keyword i.e. ATOMS1, ATOMS2, ATOMS3... </td>

\par Options

 <table align=center frame=void width=95%% cellpadding=5%%> 
<tr>
<td width=15%> <b> NUMERICAL_DERIVATIVES </b></td>
<td> ( default=off ) calculate the derivatives for these quantities numerically </td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td width=15%> <b> SERIAL </b></td>
<td> ( default=off ) do the calculation in serial.  Do not parallelize </td>

<td width=15%> <b> LOWMEM </b></td>

 <table align=center frame=void width=95%% cellpadding=5%%> 
<tr>
<td width=15%> <b> TOL </b></td>
<td> this keyword can be used to speed up your calculation. When accumulating sums in which the individual terms are numbers inbetween zero and one it is assumed that terms less than a certain tolerance make only a small contribution to the sum.  They can thus be safely ignored as can the the derivatives wrt these small quantities. </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width=15%> <b> BETWEEN </b></td>
<td> calculate the number of values that are within a certain range. These quantities are calculated using kernel density estimation as described on \ref histogrambead. The final value can be referenced using <em>label</em>.between.  You can use multiple instances of this keyword i.e. BETWEEN1, BETWEEN2, BETWEEN3...  The corresponding values are then referenced using <em>label</em>.between-1,  <em>label</em>.between-2,  <em>label</em>.between-3... </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width=15%> <b> HISTOGRAM </b></td>
<td> calculate a discretized histogram of the distribution of values. This shortcut allows you to calculates NBIN quantites like BETWEEN. </td>

\par Examples

The following provides an example of the input for the torsions command

\verbatim
TORSIONS ...
ATOMS1=168,170,172,188
ATOMS2=170,172,188,190
ATOMS3=188,190,192,230 
LABEL=ab
... TORSIONS
PRINT ARG=ab.* FILE=colvar STRIDE=10
\endverbatim

Writing out the atoms involved in all the torsions in this way can be rather tedious. Thankfully if you are working with protein you
can avoid this by using the \ref MOLINFO command.  PLUMED uses the pdb file that you provide to this command to learn 
about the topology of the protein molecule.  This means that you can specify torsion angles using the following syntax:

\verbatim
MOLINFO MOLTYPE=protein STRUCTURE=myprotein.pdb
TORSIONS ...
ATOMS1=@phi-3
ATOMS2=@psi-3
ATOMS3=@phi-4
LABEL=ab
... TORSIONS 
PRINT ARG=ab FILE=colvar STRIDE=10
\endverbatim

Here, \@phi-3 tells plumed that you would like to calculate the \f$\phi\f$ angle in the third residue of the protein.  
Similarly \@psi-4 tells plumed that you want to calculate the \f$\psi\f$ angle of the 4th residue of the protein.
