Calculate SPRINT topological variables.

The SPRINT topological variables are calculated from the largest eigenvalue, \f$\lambda\f$ of
an \f$n\times n\f$ adjacency matrix and its corresponding eigenvector, \f$\mathbf{V}\f$, using:

\f[
s_i = \sqrt{n} \lambda v_i
\f]

You can use different quantities to measure whether or not two given atoms/molecules are
adjacent or not in the adjacency matrix.  The simplest measure of adjacency is is whether
two atoms/molecules are within some cutoff of each other.  Further complexity can be added by 
insisting that two molecules are adjacent if they are within a certain distance of each 
other and if they have similar orientations.

\par Examples

This example input calculates the 7 SPRINT coordinates for a 7 atom cluster of Lennard-Jones
atoms and prints their values to a file.  In this input the SPRINT coordinates are calculated
in the manner described in ?? so two atoms are adjacent if they are within a cutoff:

\verbatim
DENSITY SPECIES=1-7 LABEL=d1
SPRINT ARG=d1 SWITCH={RATIONAL R_0=0.1} LABEL=ss
PRINT ARG=ss.* FILE=colvar 
\endverbatim

This example input calculates the 14 SPRINT coordinates foa a molecule composed of 7 hydrogen and
7 carbon atoms.  Once again two atoms are adjacent if they are within a cutoff:

\verbatim
DENSITY SPECIES=1-7 LABEL=c
DENSITY SPECIES=8-14 LABEL=h

SPRINT ...
 ARG=c,h
 SWITCH11={RATIONAL R_0=2.6 NN=6 MM=12}
 SWITCH12={RATIONAL R_0=2.2 NN=6 MM=12}
 SWITCH22={RATIONAL R_0=2.2 NN=6 MM=12}
 LABEL=ss
... SPRINT

PRINT ARG=ss.* FILE=colvar
\endverbatim
