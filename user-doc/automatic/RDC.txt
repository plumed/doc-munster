Calculates the Residual Dipolar Coupling between two atoms. 

The RDC between two atomic nuclei depends on the \f$\theta\f$ angle between 
the inter-nuclear vector and the external magnetic field. In isotropic media RDCs average to zero because of the orientational 
averaging, but when the rotational symmetry is broken, either through the introduction of an alignment medium or for molecules 
with highly anisotropic paramagnetic susceptibility, RDCs become measurable.

\f[
D=D_{max}0.5(3\cos^2(\theta)-1)
\f]

where

\f[
D_{max}=-\mu_0\gamma_1\gamma_2h/(8\pi^3r^3)
\f]

that is the maximal value of the dipolar coupling for the two nuclear spins with gyromagnetic ratio \f$\gamma\f$. 
\f$\mu\f$ is the magnetic constant and h is the Planck constant. 

Common Gyromagnetic Ratios (C.G.S)
- H(1) 26.7513
- C(13) 6.7261
- N(15) -2.7116
- NH -72.5388

This collective variable calculates the Residual Dipolar Coupling for a set of couple of atoms using the above definition. 
From the calculated RDCs and a set of experimental values it calculates either their correlation or the squared quality factor 

\f[
Q^2=\frac{\sum_i(D_i-D^{exp}_i)^2}{\sum_i(D^{exp}_i)^2}
\f]

RDCs report only on the fraction of molecules that is aligned, this means that comparing the RDCs from a single structure in
a MD simulation to the experimental values is not particularly meaningfull, from this point of view it is better to compare
their correlation. The fraction of aligned molecules can be obtained by maximising the correlation between the calculated and 
the experimental RDCs. This fraction can be used as a scaling factor in the calculation of the RDCs in order to compare their
values. The averaging of the RDCs calculated with the above definition from a standard MD should result to 0 because of
the rotational diffusion, but this variable can be used to break the rotational symmetry.

RDCs can also be calculated using a Single Value Decomposition approach, in this case the code rely on the
a set of function from the GNU Scientific Library (GSL). (With SVD forces are not currently implemented).

Replica-Averaged restrained simulations can be performed with this CV using the ENSEMBLE flag.
