Calculate SPRINT topological variables.

The SPRINT topological variables are calculated from the largest eigenvalue, \f$\lambda\f$ of
an \f$n\times n\f$ adjacency matrix and its corresponding eigenvector, \f$\mathbf{V}\f$, using:

\f[
s_i = \sqrt{n} \lambda v_i
\f]

You can use different quantities to measure whether or not two given atoms/molecules are
adjacent or not in the adjacency matrix.  The simplest measure of adjacency is is whether
two atoms/molecules are within some cutoff of each other.  Further complexity can be added by 
insisting that two molecules are adjacent if they are within a certain distance of each 
other and if they have similar orientations.

\par Description of components

By default this Action calculates the following quantities. These quanties can be referenced elsewhere in the input by using this Action's label followed by a dot and the name of the quantity required from the list below.

<tr>
<td width=15%> <b> coord </b></td>

\par Examples

This example input calculates the 7 SPRINT coordinates for a 7 atom cluster of Lennard-Jones
atoms and prints their values to a file.  In this input the SPRINT coordinates are calculated
in the manner described in ?? so two atoms are adjacent if they are within a cutoff:

\verbatim
DENSITY SPECIES=1-7 LABEL=d1
SPRINT ARG=d1 SWITCH={RATIONAL R_0=0.1} LABEL=ss
PRINT ARG=ss.* FILE=colvar 
\endverbatim

This example input calculates the 14 SPRINT coordinates foa a molecule composed of 7 hydrogen and
7 carbon atoms.  Once again two atoms are adjacent if they are within a cutoff:

\verbatim
DENSITY SPECIES=1-7 LABEL=c
DENSITY SPECIES=8-14 LABEL=h

SPRINT ...
 ARG=c,h
 SWITCH11={RATIONAL R_0=2.6 NN=6 MM=12}
 SWITCH12={RATIONAL R_0=2.2 NN=6 MM=12}
 SWITCH22={RATIONAL R_0=2.2 NN=6 MM=12}
 LABEL=ss
... SPRINT

PRINT ARG=ss.* FILE=colvar
\endverbatim
