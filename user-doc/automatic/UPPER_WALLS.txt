Defines a wall for the value of one or more collective variables,
 which limits the region of the phase space accessible during the simulation. 

The restraining potential starts acting on the system when the value of the CV is greater 
(in the case of UPPER_WALLS) or lower (in the case of LOWER_WALLS) than a certain limit \f$a_i\f$ (AT) 
minus an offset \f$o_i\f$ (OFFSET).
The expression for the bias due to the wall is given by:

\f$
  \sum_i {k_i}((x_i-a_i+o_i)/s_i)^e_i
\f$

\f$k_i\f$ (KAPPA) is an energy constant in internal unit of the code, \f$s_i\f$ (EPS) a rescaling factor and 
\f$e_i\f$ (EXP) the exponent determining the power law. By default: EXP = 2, EPS = 1.0, OFF = 0.


\par Description of components

By default this Action calculates the following quantities. These quanties can be referenced elsewhere in the input by using this Action's label followed by a dot and the name of the quantity required from the list below.

<td> the input for this action is the scalar output from one or more other actions. The particular scalars that you will use are referenced using the label of the action. If the label appears on its own then it is assumed that the Action calculates a single scalar value.  The value of this scalar is thus used as the input to this new action.  If * or *.* appears the scalars calculated by all the proceding actions in the input file are taken.  Some actions have multi-component outputs and each component of the output has a specific label.  For example a \ref DISTANCE action labelled dist may have three componets x, y and z.  To take just the x component you should use dist.x, if you wish to take all three components then use dist.*.More information on the referencing of Actions can be found in the section of the manual on the PLUMED \ref Syntax.  Scalar values can also be referenced using POSIX regular expressions as detailed in the section on \ref Regex. To use this feature you you must compile PLUMED with the appropriate flag. </td>

\par Examples
The following input tells plumed to add both a lower and an upper walls on the distance 
between atoms 3 and 5 and the distance between atoms 2 and 4. The lower and upper limits
are defined at different values. The strength of the walls is the same for the four cases. 
It also tells plumed to print the energy of the walls. 
\verbatim
DISTANCE ATOMS=3,5 LABEL=d1
DISTANCE ATOMS=2,4 LABEL=d2
UPPER_WALLS ARG=d1,d2 AT=1.0,1.5 KAPPA=150.0,150.0 EXP=2,2 EPS=1,1 OFFSET 0,0 LABEL=uwall
LOWER_WALLS ARG=d1,d2 AT=0.0,1.0 KAPPA=150.0,150.0 EXP=2,2 EPS=1,1 OFFSET 0,0 LABEL=lwall
PRINT ARG=uwall.bias,lwall.bias
\endverbatim
