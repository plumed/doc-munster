Calculates the deviation of current distances from experimental NOE derived distances.

NOE distances are calculated between couple of atoms, averaging over equivalent couples, and compared with a set of reference distances. 
Distances can also be averaged over multiple replicas to perform replica-averaged simulations.
Each NOE is defined by two groups containing the same number of atoms and by a reference distance, distances
are calculated in pairs.

\f[
NOE() = \sum_i^{noes}((\frac{1}{N_{eq}}\sum_j^{N_{eq}} (\frac{1}{r_j^6}))^{\frac{-1}{6}} - d_i^{exp})^2 
\f]

Reference distances can also be considered as upper limits only, in this case the sum is over a half
parabola. 

\par Examples
In the following examples three noes are defined, the first is calculated based on the distances
of atom 1-2 and 3-2; the second is defined by the distance 5-7 and the third by the distances
4-15,4-16,8-15,8-16.
