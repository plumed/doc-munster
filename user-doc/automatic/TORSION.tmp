Calculate a torsional angle.

This command can be used to compute the torsion between four atoms or alternatively
to calculate the angle between two vectors projected on the plane
orthogonal to an axis. 

\par Examples

This input tells plumed to print the torsional angle between atoms 1, 2, 3 and 4
on file COLVAR.
\verbatim
t: TORSION ATOMS=1,2,3,4
# this is an alternative, equivalent, definition:
# t: TORSION VECTOR1=2,1 AXIS=2,3 VECTOR2=3,4
PRINT ARG=t FILE=COLVAR
\endverbatim

If you are working with a protein you can specify the special named torsion angles \f$\phi\f$, \f$\psi\f$, \f$\omega\f$ and \f$\chi_1\f$
by using TORSION in combination with the \ref MOLINFO command.  This can be done by using the following 
syntax.

\verbatim
MOLINFO MOLTYPE=protein STRUCTURE=myprotein.pdb
t1: TORSION ATOMS=@phi-3
t2: TORSION ATOMS=@psi-4
PRINT ARG=t1,t2 FILE=colvar STRIDE=10
\endverbatim

Here, \@phi-3 tells plumed that you would like to calculate the \f$\phi\f$ angle in the third residue of the protein.
Similarly \@psi-4 tells plumed that you want to calculate the \f$\psi\f$ angle of the 4th residue of the protein.
