Calculate number of pairs of atoms/molecules that are "linked"

In its simplest guise this coordinate calculates a coordination number.  Each pair
of atoms is assumed "linked" if they are within some cutoff of each other.  In more 
complex applications each entity is a vector and this quantity measures whether
pairs of vectors are (a) within a certain cutoff and (b) if the two vectors have 
similar orientations.  The vectors on individual atoms could be Steinhardt parameters
(see \ref Q3, \ref Q4 and \ref Q6) or they could describe some internal vector in a molecule.

\par Examples

The following calculates how many bonds there are in a system containing 64 atoms and outputs
this quantity to a file.

\verbatim
DENSITY SPECIES=1-64 LABEL=d1
NLINKS ARG=d1 SWITCH={RATIONAL D_0=1.3 R_0=0.2} LABEL=dd
PRINT ARG=dd FILE=colvar
\endverbatim

The following calculates how many pairs of neighbouring atoms in a system containg 64 atoms have
similar dispositions for the atoms in their coordination sphere.  This calculation uses the 
dot product of the Q6 vectors on adjacent atoms to measure whether or not two atoms have the same
``orientation"

\verbatim
Q6 SPECIES=1-64 SWITCH={RATIONAL D_0=1.3 R_0=0.2} LABEL=q6
NLINKS ARG=q6 SWITCH={RATIONAL D_0=1.3 R_0=0.2} LABEL=dd
PRINT ARG=dd FILE=colvar
\endverbatim
