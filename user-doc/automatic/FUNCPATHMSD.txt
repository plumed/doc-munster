This function calculates path collective variables. 

This is the Path Collective Variables implementation 
( see \cite brand07 ).
This variable computes the progress along a given set of frames that is provided  
in input ("s" component) and the distance from them ("z" component). 
It is a function of MSD that are obtained by the joint use of MSD variable and SQUARED flag 
(see below).

\par Description of components

By default this Action calculates the following quantities. These quanties can be referenced elsewhere in the input by using this Action's label followed by a dot and the name of the quantity required from the list below.

 <table align=center frame=void width=95%% cellpadding=5%%> 
<tr> <td width=5%> <b> Quantity </b> </td> <td> <b> Description </b> </td> </tr>
<tr>
<td width=15%> <b> s </b></td>
<td> the position on the path </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width=15%> <b> z </b></td>
<td> the distance from the path </td>

<td> the input for this action is the scalar output from one or more other actions. The particular scalars that you will use are referenced using the label of the action. If the label appears on its own then it is assumed that the Action calculates a single scalar value.  The value of this scalar is thus used as the input to this new action.  If * or *.* appears the scalars calculated by all the proceding actions in the input file are taken.  Some actions have multi-component outputs and each component of the output has a specific label.  For example a \ref DISTANCE action labelled dist may have three componets x, y and z.  To take just the x component you should use dist.x, if you wish to take all three components then use dist.*.More information on the referencing of Actions can be found in the section of the manual on the PLUMED \ref Syntax.  Scalar values can also be referenced using POSIX regular expressions as detailed in the section on \ref Regex. To use this feature you you must compile PLUMED with the appropriate flag. </td>

\par Examples

Here below is a case where you have defined three frames and you want to  
calculate the progress alng the path and the distance from it in p1

\verbatim
t1: RMSD REFERENCE=frame_1.dat TYPE=OPTIMAL SQUARED
t2: RMSD REFERENCE=frame_21.dat TYPE=OPTIMAL SQUARED
t3: RMSD REFERENCE=frame_42.dat TYPE=OPTIMAL SQUARED
p1: FUNCPATHMSD ARG=t1,t2,t3 LAMBDA=500.0 
PRINT ARG=t1,t2,t3,p1.s,p1.z STRIDE=1 FILE=colvar FMT=%8.4f
\endverbatim

In this second example is shown how to define a PATH in the \ref CONTACTMAP space:

\verbatim
CONTACTMAP ...
ATOMS1=1,2 REFERENCE1=0.1  
ATOMS2=3,4 REFERENCE2=0.5  
ATOMS3=4,5 REFERENCE3=0.25  
ATOMS4=5,6 REFERENCE4=0.0  
SWITCH=(RATIONAL R_0=1.5) 
LABEL=c1
CMDIST
... CONTACTMAP

CONTACTMAP ...
ATOMS1=1,2 REFERENCE1=0.3  
ATOMS2=3,4 REFERENCE2=0.9  
ATOMS3=4,5 REFERENCE3=0.45  
ATOMS4=5,6 REFERENCE4=0.1  
SWITCH=(RATIONAL R_0=1.5) 
LABEL=c2
CMDIST
... CONTACTMAP

CONTACTMAP ...
ATOMS1=1,2 REFERENCE1=1.0  
ATOMS2=3,4 REFERENCE2=1.0  
ATOMS3=4,5 REFERENCE3=1.0  
ATOMS4=5,6 REFERENCE4=1.0  
SWITCH=(RATIONAL R_0=1.5) 
LABEL=c3
CMDIST
... CONTACTMAP

p1: FUNCPATHMSD ARG=c1,c2,c3 LAMBDA=500.0 
PRINT ARG=c1,c2,c3,p1.s,p1.z STRIDE=1 FILE=colvar FMT=%8.4f
\endverbatim
