Print quantities to a file.

This directive can be used multiple times
in the input so you can print files with different strides or print different quantities 
to different files.  You can control the buffering of output using the \subpage FLUSH keyword.

<td> the input for this action is the scalar output from one or more other actions. The particular scalars that you will use are referenced using the label of the action. If the label appears on its own then it is assumed that the Action calculates a single scalar value.  The value of this scalar is thus used as the input to this new action.  If * or *.* appears the scalars calculated by all the proceding actions in the input file are taken.  Some actions have multi-component outputs and each component of the output has a specific label.  For example a \ref DISTANCE action labelled dist may have three componets x, y and z.  To take just the x component you should use dist.x, if you wish to take all three components then use dist.*.More information on the referencing of Actions can be found in the section of the manual on the PLUMED \ref Syntax.  Scalar values can also be referenced using POSIX regular expressions as detailed in the section on \ref Regex. To use this feature you you must compile PLUMED with the appropriate flag. </td>

\par Examples
The following input instructs plumed to print the distance between atoms 3 and 5 on a file 
called COLVAR every 10 steps, and the distance and total energy on a file called COLVAR_ALL
every 1000 steps.
\verbatim
DISTANCE ATOMS=2,5 LABEL=distance
ENERGY             LABEL=energy
PRINT ARG=distance          STRIDE=10   FILE=COLVAR
PRINT ARG=distance,energy   STRIDE=1000 FILE=COLVAR_ALL
\endverbatim
(See also \ref DISTANCE and \ref ENERGY).
