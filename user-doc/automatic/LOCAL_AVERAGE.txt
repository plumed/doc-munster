Calculate averages over spherical regions centered on atoms

As is explained in <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iDvZmbWE5ps"> this video </a> certain multicolvars
calculate one scalar quantity or one vector for each of the atoms in the system.  For example 
\ref COORDINATIONNUMBER measures the coordination number of each of the atoms in the system and \ref Q4 measures
the 4th order Steinhardt parameter for each of the atoms in the system.  These quantities provide tell us something about
the disposition of the atoms in the first coordination sphere of each of the atoms of interest.  Lechner and Dellago \cite dellago-q6
have suggested that one can probe local order in a system by taking the average value of such symmetry functions over
the atoms within a spherical cutoff of each of these atoms in the systems.  When this is done with Steinhardt parameters
they claim this gives a coordinate that is better able to distinguish solid and liquid configurations of Lennard-Jones atoms. 

You can calculate such locally averaged quantities within plumed by using the LOCAL_AVERAGE command.  This command calculates 
the following atom-centered quantities:

\f[
s_i = \frac{ c_i + \sum_j \sigma(r_{ij})c_j }{ 1 + \sum_j \sigma(r_{ij}) } 
\f]

where the \f$c_i\f$ and \f$c_j\f$ values can be for any one of the symmetry functions that can be calculated using plumed 
multicolvars.  The function \f$\sigma( r_{ij} )\f$ is a \ref switchingfunction that acts on the distance between 
atoms \f$i\f$ and \f$j\f$.  Lechner and Dellago suggest that the parameters of this function should be set so that it the function is equal to one
when atom \f$j\f$ is in the first coordination sphere of atom \f$i\f$ and is zero otherwise.  

The \f$s_i\f$ quantities calculated using the above command can be again thought of as atom-centred symmetry functions.  They 
thus operate much like multicolvars.  You can thus calculate properties of the distribution of \f$s_i\f$ values using MEAN, LESS_THAN, HISTOGRAM
and so on.  You can also probe the value of these averaged variables in regions of the box by using the command in tandem with the 
\ref AROUND command.

\par Description of components

When the label of this action is used as the input for a second you are not referring to a scalar quantity as you are in regular collective variables.  The label is used to reference the full set of quantities calculated by the action.  This is usual when using \ref multicolvarfunction. Generally when doing this the previously calculated multicolvar will be referenced using the DATA keyword rather than ARG.

This Action can be used to calculate the following scalar quantities directly.  These quantities are calculated by employing the keywords listed below. These quantities can then be referenced elsewhere in the input file by using this Action's label followed by a dot and the name of the quantity. Some amongst them can be calculated multiple times with different parameters.  In this case the quantities calculated can be referenced elsewhere in the input by using the name of the quantity followed by a numerical identifier e.g. <em>label</em>.lessthan-1, <em>label</em>.lessthan-2 etc.  When doing this and, for clarity we have made the label of the components customizable. As such by using the LABEL keyword in the description of the keyword input you can customize the component name

\par Examples

This example input calculates the coordination numbers for all the atoms in the system.  These coordination numbers are then averaged over
spherical regions.  The number of averaged coordination numbers that are greater than 4 is then output to a file.

\verbatim
COORDINATIONNUMBER SPECIES=1-64 D_0=1.3 R_0=0.2 LABEL=d1
LOCAL_AVERAGE ARG=d1 SWITCH={RATIONAL D_0=1.3 R_0=0.2} MORE_THAN={RATIONAL R_0=4} LABEL=la
PRINT ARG=la.* FILE=colvar 
\endverbatim

This example input calculates the \f$q_4\f$ (see \ref Q4) vectors for each of the atoms in the system.  These vectors are then averaged 
component by component over a spherical region.  The average value for this quantity is then outputeed to a file.  This calculates the 
quantities that were used in the paper by Lechner and Dellago \cite dellago-q6 

\verbatim
Q4 SPECIES=1-64 SWITCH={RATIONAL D_0=1.3 R_0=0.2} LABEL=q4
LOCAL_AVERAGE ARG=q4 SWITCH={RATIONAL D_0=1.3 R_0=0.2} MEAN LABEL=la
PRINT ARG=la.* FILE=colvar
