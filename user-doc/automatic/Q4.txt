Calculate 4th order Steinhardt parameters.

The 4th order Steinhardt parameters allow us to measure the degree to which the first coordination shell
around an atom is ordered.  The Steinhardt parameter for atom, \f$i\f$ is complex vector whose components are 
calculated using the following formula:

\f[
q_{4m}(i) = \frac{\sum_j \sigma( r_{ij} ) Y_{4m}(\mathbf{r}_{ij}) }{\sum_j \sigma( r_{ij} ) }
\f]

where \f$Y_{4m}\f$ is one of the 4th order spherical harmonics so \f$m\f$ is a number that runs from \f$-4\f$ to
\f$+4\f$.  The function \f$\sigma( r_{ij} )\f$ is a \ref switchingfunction that acts on the distance between 
atoms \f$i\f$ and \f$j\f$.  The parameters of this function should be set so that it the function is equal to one
when atom \f$j\f$ is in the first coordination sphere of atom \f$i\f$ and is zero otherwise.  

The Steinhardt parameters can be used to measure the degree of order in the system in a variety of different ways.  The
simplest way of measuring whether or not the coordination sphere is ordered is to simply take the norm of the above vector i.e.

\f[
Q_4(i) = \sqrt{ \sum_{m=-4}^4 q_{4m}(i)^{*} q_{4m}(i) }
\f]

This norm is small when the coordination shell is disordered and larger when the coordination shell is ordered. Furthermore, when 
the keywords LESS_THAN, MIN, MAX, HISTOGRAM, MEAN and so on are used with this colvar it is the distribution of these normed quantities
that is investigated.  

Other measures of order can be taken by averaging the components of the individual \f$q_4\f$ vectors individually or by taking dot products of 
the \f$q_{4}\f$ vectors on adjacent atoms.  More information on these variables can be found in the documentation for \ref LOCAL_Q4,
\ref LOCAL_AVERAGE and \ref NLINKS.

\par Description of components

When the label of this action is used as the input for a second you are not referring to a scalar quantity as you are in regular collective variables.  The label is used to reference the full set of quantities calculated by the action.  This is usual when using \ref multicolvarfunction. Generally when doing this the previously calculated multicolvar will be referenced using the DATA keyword rather than ARG.

This Action can be used to calculate the following scalar quantities directly.  These quantities are calculated by employing the keywords listed below. These quantities can then be referenced elsewhere in the input file by using this Action's label followed by a dot and the name of the quantity. Some amongst them can be calculated multiple times with different parameters.  In this case the quantities calculated can be referenced elsewhere in the input by using the name of the quantity followed by a numerical identifier e.g. <em>label</em>.lessthan-1, <em>label</em>.lessthan-2 etc.  When doing this and, for clarity we have made the label of the components customizable. As such by using the LABEL keyword in the description of the keyword input you can customize the component name

\par Examples

The following command calculates the average Q4 parameter for the 64 atoms in a box of Lennard Jones and prints this
quantity to a file called colvar:

\verbatim
Q4 SPECIES=1-64 D_0=1.3 R_0=0.2 MEAN LABEL=q4
PRINT ARG=q4.mean FILE=colvar
\endverbatim

The following command calculates the histogram of Q4 parameters for the 64 atoms in a box of Lennard Jones and prints these
quantities to a file called colvar:

\verbatim
Q4 SPECIES=1-64 D_0=1.3 R_0=0.2 HISTOGRAM={GAUSSIAN LOWER=0.0 UPPER=1.0 NBINS=20 SMEAR=0.1} LABEL=q4
PRINT ARG=q4.* FILE=colvar
\endverbatim

The following command could be used to measure the Q4 paramters that describe the arrangement of chlorine ions around the
sodium atoms in NaCl.  The imagined system here is composed of 64 NaCl formula units and the atoms are arranged in the input
with the 64 Na\f$^+\f$ ions followed by the 64 Cl\f$-\f$ ions.  Once again the average Q4 paramter is calculated and output to a 
file called colvar

\verbatim
Q4 SPECIESA=1-64 SPECIESB=65-128 D_0=1.3 R_0=0.2 MEAN LABEL=q4
PRINT ARG=q4.mean FILE=colvar
