Calculates the deviation of current distances from experimental NOE derived distances.

NOE distances are calculated between couple of atoms, averaging over equivalent couples, and compared with a set of reference distances. 
Distances can also be averaged over multiple replicas to perform replica-averaged simulations.
Each NOE is defined by two groups containing the same number of atoms and by a reference distance, distances
are calculated in pairs.

\f[
NOE() = \sum_i^{noes}((\frac{1}{N_{eq}}\sum_j^{N_{eq}} (\frac{1}{r_j^6}))^{\frac{-1}{6}} - d_i^{exp})^2 
\f]

Reference distances can also be considered as upper limits only, in this case the sum is over a half
parabola. 

\par The atoms involved can be specified using

 <table align=center frame=void width=95%% cellpadding=5%%> 
<tr>
<td width=15%> <b> GROUPA </b></td>
<td> the atoms involved in each of the contacts you wish to calculate. Keywords like GROUPA1, GROUPA2, GROUPA3,... should be listed and one contact will be calculated for each ATOM keyword you specify. You can use multiple instances of this keyword i.e. GROUPA1, GROUPA2, GROUPA3... </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width=15%> <b> GROUPB </b></td>
<td> the atoms involved in each of the contacts you wish to calculate. Keywords like GROUPB1, GROUPB2, GROUPB3,... should be listed and one contact will be calculated for each ATOM keyword you specify. You can use multiple instances of this keyword i.e. GROUPB1, GROUPB2, GROUPB3... </td>

\par Examples
In the following examples three noes are defined, the first is calculated based on the distances
of atom 1-2 and 3-2; the second is defined by the distance 5-7 and the third by the distances
4-15,4-16,8-15,8-16.

GROUPA3=4,4,8,8 GROUPB3=15,16,15,16 NOEDIST3=0.3
