Calculate the center of mass for a group of atoms.

The computed
center of mass is stored as a virtual atom that can be accessed in
an atom list through the label for the COM action that creates it.

For arbitrary weights (e.g. geometric center) see \ref CENTER.

When running with periodic boundary conditions, the user should take care 
that the atoms in the COM group actually are in the proper periodic image.
This is typically achieved using the \ref WHOLEMOLECULES action
before COM calculation.

\par The atoms involved can be specified using

 <table align=center frame=void width=95%% cellpadding=5%%> 
<tr>
<td width=15%> <b> ATOMS </b></td>
<td> the list of atoms which are involved the virtual atom's definition.  For more information on how to specify lists of atoms see \ref Group </td>
</tr>
</table>

\par Examples

The following input instructs plumed to print the distance between the
center of mass for atoms 1,2,3,4,5,6,7 and that for atoms 15,20:
\verbatim
COM ATOMS=1-7         LABEL=c1
COM ATOMS=15,20       LABEL=c2
DISTANCE ATOMS=c1,c2  LABEL=d1
PRINT ARG=d1
\endverbatim
(See also \ref DISTANCE and \ref PRINT).
