Calculate the x components of the vectors connecting one or many pairs of atoms.  
You can then calculate functions of the distribution of
values such as the minimum, the number less than a certain quantity and so on. 

\par Examples

The following input tells plumed to calculate the x-component of the vector connecting atom 3 to atom 5 and 
the x-component of the vector connecting atom 1 to atom 2.  The minimum of these two quantities is then 
printed 
\verbatim
XDISTANCES ATOMS1=3,5 ATOMS2=1,2 MIN={BETA=0.1} LABEL=d1
PRINT ARG=d1.min
\endverbatim
(See also \ref PRINT).


The following input tells plumed to calculate the x-component of the vector connecting atom 3 to atom 5 and 
the x-component of the vector connecting atom 1 to atom 2.  The number of values that are 
less than 0.1nm is then printed to a file.
\verbatim
XDISTANCES ATOMS1=3,5 ATOMS2=1,2 LABEL=d1 LESS_THAN={RATIONAL R_0=0.1}
PRINT ARG=d1.lt0.1
\endverbatim
(See also \ref PRINT \ref switchingfunction).

The following input tells plumed to calculate the x-components of all the distinct vectors that can be created 
between atoms 1, 2 and 3 (i.e. the vectors between atoms 1 and 2, atoms 1 and 3 and atoms 2 and 3).  
The average of these quantities is then calculated.
\verbatim
XDISTANCES GROUP=1-3 AVERAGE LABEL=d1
PRINT ARG=d1.average
\endverbatim
(See also \ref PRINT)

The following input tells plumed to calculate all the vectors connecting the the atoms in GROUPA to the atoms in GROUPB.
In other words the vector between atoms 1 and 2 and the vector between atoms 1 and 3.  The number of values 
more than 0.1 is then printed to a file.
\verbatim
XDISTANCES GROUPA=1 GROUPB=2,3 MORE_THAN={RATIONAL R_0=0.1}
PRINT ARG=d1.gt0.1 
\endverbatim
(See also \ref PRINT \ref switchingfunction)
