Calculate the dipole moment for a group of atoms.

\par Examples
The following tells plumed to calculate the dipole of the group of atoms containing
the atoms from 1-10 and print it every 5 steps
\verbatim
d: DIPOLE GROUP=1-10
PRINT FILE=output STRIDE=5 ARG=5
\endverbatim
(see also \ref PRINT)

\attention 
If the total charge Q of the group in non zero, then a charge Q/N will be subtracted to every atom,
where N is the number of atoms. This implies that the dipole (which for a charged system depends
on the position) is computed on the geometric center of the group.
