This Colvar calculates path collective variables. 

This is the Path Collective Variables implementation 
( see \cite brand07 ).
This variable computes the progress along a given set of frames that is provided  
in input ("sss" component) and the distance from them ("zzz" component). 
(see below).

\par Examples

Here below is a case where you have defined three frames and you want to  
calculate the progress along the path and the distance from it in p1

\verbatim
p1: PATHMSD REFERENCE=file.pdb  LAMBDA=500.0 NEIGH_STRIDE=4 NEIGH_SIZE=8 
PRINT ARG=p1.sss,p1.zzz STRIDE=1 FILE=colvar FMT=%8.4f
\endverbatim

note that NEIGH_STRIDE=4 NEIGH_SIZE=8 control the neighborlist parameter (optional but
recommended for performance) and states that the neighbor list will be calculated every 4
timesteps and consider only the closest 8 member to the actual md snapshots.

In the REFERENCE PDB file the frames must be separated either using END or ENDMDL.

\note
The implementation of this collective variable and of \ref PROPERTYMAP
is shared, as well as most input options.
