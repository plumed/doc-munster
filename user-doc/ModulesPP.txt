/**

@page mymodules List of modules

The functionality in PLUMED 2 is divided into a small number of modules.  Some
users may only wish to use a subset of the functionality available within the 
code while others may wish to use some of PLUMED's more complicated features.
For this reason the plumed source code is divided into modules, which users can
activate or deactivate to their hearts content.  

- To activate a module add a file called modulename.on to the plumed2/src directory  
- To deactivate a module add a file called modulename.off to the plumed2/src directory

Obviously, in the above instructions modulename should be replaced by the name of the
module that you would like to activate or deactivate.

Some modules are active by default in the version of PLUMED 2 that you download from 
the website while others are inactive.  The following lists all of the modules that
are available in plumed and tells you whether or not they are active by default.
